# Compiler-Design
Basic Compiler Design Program using Lex, Flex and Yacc tool.
I am going to implement basic program for design a simple compiler for different purpose.
I used Lex, Flex, Bison and Yacc tool for that purpose. For design any compiler we must have knowledge of Theory of Computation (Grammer).
